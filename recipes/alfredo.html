    <p>This homemade alfredo sauce is way easier than expected, and so much better than store bought.</p>
    <p>It does include cream because making it the "traditional way" never worked for us, and also it's just good?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp and 1/2 tsp kosher salt, divided </li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 Cups heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>9 oz fresh fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>2 oz parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp freshly grated nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of water with 1 tablespoon of salt to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, add 1 cup heavy cream and the butter to a large skillet. 
            Melt over medium-low heat and allow the mixture to reduce by one third, about 5-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the sauce is reduced, turn the heat off and add the remaining 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the skillet. 
            Season with the remaining salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the pasta to the boiling water. Cook according to the manufacturer's directions for ‘al dente’ pasta, about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the cooked pasta directly into the skillet with the heavy cream sauce. Reserve the pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the heat to low and add the parmesan and nutmeg to the pasta. Cook the pasta and sauce for about 1-2 minutes, 
            stirring with tongs, until the cheese is melted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add about 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water to the sauce. Once again, stir with the tongs until the sauce is glossy 
            and coats the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately. 
        </li>
    </ol>
