    <h1>Spaghetti That Tastes More Expensive Than It Is</h1>

    <h2>This is seriously the best spaghetti I have ever had.</h2>
    <p>While this recipe is not very complex, it does take a while. You have to give everything time to simmer together and develop
        all of those complex flavors. I promise it is worth it.
    </p>
    <p>The mushroom broth makes it taste meaty without the inclusion of any meat, and as a certified garlic girl, the slow-simmered 
        garlic is a game changer.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces mushrooms (I prefer shiitake, but any kind works)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup peeled garlic cloves (4 ounces, or like 2-3 bulbs)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Two 28-ounce cans peeled tomatoes with their juices</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Fresh ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/4 cup torn basil</li>
        <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese, for some razzle-dazzle</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, bring the mushrooms and 3 cups of water to a boil.
            Simmer over moderate heat until the broth is reduced to 1 cup, 1 hour. Strain and discard the mushrooms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring the garlic and olive oil to a boil. Simmer over moderately low heat, 
            stirring, until the garlic is very tender and golden, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large enameled cast-iron casserole or Dutch oven, bring the tomatoes and the garlic and oil to a boil. 
            Add the mushroom broth and, using an immersion blender, puree the sauce until smooth. Bring the sauce back to a boil, 
            then simmer over moderately low heat until thickened, about 1 hour. Season the sauce with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain the spaghetti and return to the pot. 
            Add 2 cups of the sauce and cook, tossing, for 1 minute. Transfer the spaghetti to bowls, top with the basil and 
            serve with grated cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
